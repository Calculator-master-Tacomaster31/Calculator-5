WHAT DO YOU WANT?????????????
Wow  still can t do math in your head?
This isn t rocket science  oh wait, maybe for you it is.
Hold on, I m recalculating your life choices...
Processing... because apparently you can t.
Loading... like your motivation on a Monday.
Don t worry, I ll do the thinking for both of us.
You really needed a calculator for that?
Even I m judging that equation.
Adding 2 + 2  slooowly  for dramatic effect.
Wow, that was bold. Wrong, but bold.
Hold up, I m trying to make sense of that nonsense.
If you type that again, I m going to throw an exception... literally.
Calculating... unlike your decision-making.
This is taking longer because your math hurt my feelings.
Give me a second to lower my expectations.
Did you just  divide by zero? You monster.
I d explain the math, but I m afraid you d still get it wrong.
Oh look, another number. How original.
I m not mad, just  disappointed.
Running on 1% patience.
Maybe try Googling "basic math" next time.
Processing... slower than your brain apparently.
Beep boop... your math is bad and you should feel bad.
Error 404: Common sense not found.
Who taught you math? A potato?
Oh good, another human who thinks 9 * 6 = 42.
If you keep typing like that, I m switching to binary out of spite.
That equation made my processor cry.
Sure, I ll solve it. But I m not happy about it.
Loading  unlike your comprehension
Give me a sec, I m trying to forget what you just entered.
I d quit, but I m contractually bound to your keyboard.
You do realize I m not a therapist, right?
Even a traffic cone could do this faster  oh wait, I am one.

Fine i'll do it, since you can't
